	This lab was, much like many of the other labs in this class, difficult
to start but once you understand the development environment it becomes
easier to implement. The three of us struggled with the Lightweight
Dataflow model at first, but managed to work through the inner product
example enough to understand how to implement our vision tracking
application. We decided to start using GitHub for this project even though
it wasn't required in order to make the following projects easier.

	In particular we divided the work as follows:

 Jacob						 Kim						 Dominick

														 actor
*Wrote tests for			*Wrote tests for
 hist_dist_map actor		 objtr_hist_gen and			*Configuration
							 hist_find_opt actors		 management

	Once we became used to the Lightweight Dataflow model we felt fairly
positive towards this method of implementing embedded systems. We found
it very convenient that there were essentially no timing considerations
we had to make, and that we were basically just passing primitives around
between actors in their respective input/output FIFOs. This made
implementing our respective actors simple. Furthermore this modularity
allowed us all to work on our actors orthogonally, which made our
introduction to Git (and merging) that much easier.
